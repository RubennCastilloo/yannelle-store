            <p>If you’re looking to <a href="" class="internal-links">upgrade</a> your iPad but don’t necessarily need the latest or most powerful version of the iPad Pro, you can save a lot of money on the previous generation of the iPad Pro from 2018 for a limited time. It’s steeply discounted, and what’s better, this model includes support for 4G LTE in addition to Wi-Fi, which is handy if you’re on the go and want to stick a SIM card into it.</p>

            <p>The most appealing deal is on the 12.9-inch version of the 2018 iPad Pro with 64GB of storage and LTE support. That certainly isn’t much storage, but it’s tough to pass up this deal. And since iPads support external storage, you can offload data to a flash drive if you’d like. Normally $1,149, it’s $669 until later today (or sooner if stock sells out).</p>

            <p>Earlier this year, AT&T CEO John Stankey spoke about whether certain titles under the Warner Bros. label (WarnerMedia is a subsidiary of AT&T) would go directly to digital retailers. Warner Bros., Universal, and Disney have all pulled some of their films from theatrical releases to debut them on digital platforms amidst the pandemic. When it came to some of Warner Bros. bigger titles, Stankey ruled out Christopher Nolan’s Tenet ever getting a digital-first release. While Wonder Woman 1984 remained “unlikely” to go that route, it wasn’t impossible.</p>

            <p>“Do I think there can be some things that we built for theatrical release that migrates into a [streaming] construct? Sure,” Stankey said. “Is It going to happen on a movie like Tenet or Wonder Woman 1984? I would be very surprised... actually, I can assure you on Tenet that’s not going to be the case.”</p>

            <p>Now, however, it seems like Wonder Woman 1984 will also exclusively go to theaters. Nothing is certain, though.</p>
